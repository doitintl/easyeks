# Quick Method of Satisfying Prerequisites
* This fast method is recommended for:
  * Anyone who wants to try this out as fast as possible.
  * Jr Engineers with little prior knowledge of shells, manually provisioning an ec2 instance, ssh, and private git repos.
* It's not recommended for users planning to commit to long-term adoption of EasyEKS, 
  as it minimizes prerequisites at the cost of benefits gained by implementing the prerequisites.

## AWS Cloud Shell Instructions
* Notes: 
  * AWS Cloud Shell doesn't support installing flox / Nix pgks, so scripting is used as an alternative.
  * This assumes you have access to AWS Web Console and have admin IAM access
  * This minimizes or avoids:
    * setting up a shell environment.
    * setting up ssh
    * authenticating to a private repo (not true during alpha, but beta or 1.0 a public repo would allow this to be skipped.)
* TO DO write a guide for this.
