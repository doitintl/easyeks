## Skaffolding Methodology (Boostrapping methodology used to populate the files in this repo)
* /.flox/ files were initially generated by `flox init`.
* NixOs gets latest packages on a delay of 1-2 weeks, so it didn't have the aws-cdk pgk version 2.147.3
  which the lastest eks-blueprints 1.15.1 needs, so for now I'm using the previous version (1.14.1)
  flox.dev's packages were set to install cdk 2.133.0 (which) eks-blueprints 1.14.1 uses.
* Due to a nix cdk pgk bug  
  `npx aws-cdk@2.133.0 init app --language typescript`  
  was used in place of  
  `cdk init app --language typescript`
* `npm install npm i @aws-quickstart/eks-blueprints@1.14.1`  
  was used to configure npm dependencies needed by eks-blueprints v1.14.1
