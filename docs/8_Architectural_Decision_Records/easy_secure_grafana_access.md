# (TO DO - initial idea)
* Initial thought is IAM authn/z to SSM port forwarding to internal private LB of grafana.
* grafana admin & grafana reader
* Great UX that satisfies defense in depth, so you can safely neglect FOSS grafana and let it collect CVEs, and be slow to update it without creating security problems.
